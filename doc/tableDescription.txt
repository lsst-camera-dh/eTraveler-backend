Corresponds to db version 0.4.0

HARDWARE 
----------
1. HardwareType    [template]
'name' field  should have value = drawing id (without revision #) when there 
*is* a drawing id.
Also has a 'description' field and fields for maintaining auto-generated
sequence numbers for a specific HardwareType (if requested).

2. Hardware     [instance of HardwareType]
Instance of hardware type

3. HardwareStatus
List of allowed states for hardware, to include at least the following
values:

NEW (default value when new row is added to Hardware table)
IN_PROGRESS (at least one traveler has been begun)
REJECTED
READY    (preparation, testing, etc. complete. ready for integration)
USED
PENDING

as well as possibility for so-called labels: attributes which may be
applied to a hardware component but which are not among the standard
status values.

Also includes fields to specify whether entry is a legitimate status or
just a label, and whether it is a value required for proper operation of
eTraveler ("system") or not ("user").

4. HardwareStatusHistory
Make an entry whenever a hardware item changes status and whenever a label
is added or removed.

5. HardwareLocationHistory
Make an entry whenever a hardware item is moved to a new station or
other location

6. HardwareGroup
A hardware group encompasses one or more hardware types.  For each type,
there is an associated, identically named group.  There are also groups
containing more than one hardware type.  Traveler definitions are now
associated with a hardware group rather than a hardware type.

7. HardwareTypeGroupMapping
Keeps track of which types are associated with which groups.  A group may 
contain more than one type.  A type may be associated with more than one
group.

Hardware identifiers
--------------------
1. HardwareIdentifierAuthority  
e.g., BNL

2. HardwareIdentifier
Identifier unique to referenced authority for hardware of specific type

Hardware relationships
----------------------
1. HardwareRelationshipType    [template]
Associates two kinds of hardware, one subsidiary to the other, e.g.
raft and sensor where relationship is 'sensor installed in raft'. 
Relationship descriptions also have a 'slot' associated with them.
It defaults to 1, but for, e.g., installing CCD in a REB, there
would be three hardware relationship definitions with the same name
and different slot numbers.

2. HardwareRelationship    [instance of HardwareRelationshipType]
Instance of 1. for specific components

PROCESS
-------
1. Process   [template]
Defines process step:
Primary hardware type, aux hardware type if any, children type

2. ProcessEdge   [template]
Defines relationships between process steps

3. NextProcessVersion
Does bookkeeping needed to reliably assign next verison number when a
new version of existing process is needed.  Not used, as of 
June 19, 2015; probably should be dropped

4. Activity [instance of Process]
Where the rubber hits the road.  Execute a particular process with
particular component

5. ActivityFinalStatus
Enumeration of possible states for an activity (not necessarily final,
in spite of table name)

6. JobHarnessStep
Enumerate states of job harness job.  Nullable fk in Activity references it.

7. JobStepHistory
New entry each time a harnessed job changes state

8. ActivityStatusHistory
New entry each time an activity changes status (so-called "final status"
but it isn't always)

9. InternalAction
Enumerates special actions eTraveler may have to perform and assigns
mask bit to each.  Process definition includes mask field in which
these bits may be set.

10. PermissionGroup
Enumerates permission groups (operator, supervisor, etc.) and assigns
mask bit to each.  Process definition includes mask field in which
these bits may be set.

11. TravelerType
Enumerate traveler types.  ['state' field is no longer used; should
be eliminated in future release]

12. TravelerTypeState
Lists possible states.  Current list is 'new', 'validated', 'active',
'superseded', 'deactivated'

13. TravelerTypeStateHistory
Make an entry whenever a travelertype changes state.

14. StopWorkHistory
Create new entry for stop work action.  Update for resume or quit.

EXCEPTIONS
----------
1. ExceptionType   [template]
Describes process step navigation in case a particular known condition occurs

2. Exception [instance]
Created when NCR is initiated

PREREQUISITES
--------------
1. PrerequisiteType
Enumaration of kinds of prerequisites.  Includes as possibilities other
tracked hardware; other process steps, consumables, etc.

2. PrerequisitePattern [template]
Describes a prerequisite for a particular Process.  If it's a 
tracked hardware prereq, reference HardwareType id.  If it's a process step
prereq, reference Process id.

3. Prerequisite [instance of PrerequisitePattern]

RESULTS
-------
Certain kinds of results require an input description so that eTraveler
can produce an appropriate form for operator to fill out.  Tables 
involved in this are

0. Result
Placeholder, not currently used.  May be eliminated in a future release.

1. InputSemantics
A list of possible input categories, to include at least integer, float,
file path, arbitrary string.

2. InputPattern
References InputSemantics and Process (process this particular input
belongs to).  Required field "label". Required field to specify whether
or not the input is optional.  Optional fields for units, and
min and max values allowed.

3a. IntResultManual
Place to store manual-entry integers.

3b. IntResultHarnessed
Place to store integers coming from harnessed job result summaries

4a. FloatResultManual
Like IntResultManual, but float

4b. FloatResultHarnessed
Like IntResultHarnessed, but float

5a. FilepathResultManual
Like IntResultManual, but a string which is a filepath

5b. FilepathResultHarnessed
Like IntResultHarnessed, but filepath (identified by use of fileref schema)

6a. StringResultManual
6b. StringResultHarnessed
(Scalar) results which are not int, float or filepath are stored here
as strings.


MISC
----
1. DbRelease
major, minor, patch numbers; descriptive comment

2. Site
Site-specific information needed to run eTraveler, e.g. value to
use for $VIRTUAL_ENV environment variable required by Job Harness

3. Location
Lists locations where components might be: teststands, assembly stations, etc.
References Site. Could conceivably include things like "in transit UPS", 
in which case the site fk references responsible site.

4. JobHarness
Information associated with a particular job harness installation, such
as archive root, and also reference to Site. Not yet in actual use.
Currently job harness information is kept in Site table.
