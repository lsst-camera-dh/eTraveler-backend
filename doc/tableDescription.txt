HARDWARE 
----------
1. HardwareType    [template]
Corresponds to drawing id (without revision #)

2. Hardware     [instance of HardwareType]
Instance of hardware type

3. HardwareStatus
List of allowed states for hardware, to include at least the following
values, likely others to come:

NEW (default value when new row is added to Hardware table)
IN_PROGRESS (at least one traveler has been begun)
REJECTED
READY    (preparation, testing, etc. complete. ready for integration)
USED

Hardware identifiers
--------------------
1. HardwareIdentifierAuthority  
e.g., BNL

2. HardwareIdentifier
Identifier unique to referenced authority for hardware of specific type

Hardware relationships
----------------------
1. HardwareReleationshipType    [template]
Associates two kinds of hardware, one subsidiary to the other, e.g.
raft and sensor where relationship is 'in slot 11'

2. HardwareRelastionship    [instance of HardwareRelationshipType]
Instance of 1. for specific components

PROCESS
-------
1. Process   [template]
Defines process step:
Primary hardware type, aux hardware type if any, children type

2. ProcessEdge   [template]
Defines relationships between process steps

3. Activity [instance of Process]
Where the rubber hits the road.  Execute a particular process with
particular component


EXCEPTIONS
----------
1. NCRcondition  
Recognized conditions which will initiate an NCR

2. Exception   [template]
Describes process step navigation in case a particular known condition occurs

PREREQUISITES
--------------
1. PrerequisiteType
Enumaration of kinds of prerequisites.  Includes as possibilities other
tracked hardware; other process steps, consumables, etc.

2. PrerequisitePattern [template]
Describes a prerequisite for a particular Process.  If it's a 
tracked hardware prereq, reference HardwareType id.  If it's a process step
prereq, reference Process id.

3. Prerequisite [instance of PrerequisitePattern]

RESULTS
-------
Certain kinds of results require an input description so that eTraveler
can produce an appropriate form for operator to fill out.  Tables 
involved in this are

1. InputSemantics
A list of possible input categories, to include at least integer, float,
file path, arbitrary string.

2. InputPattern
References InputSemantics and Process (process this particular input
belongs to).  Required field "label". Optional fields for units, and
min and max values allowed.


MISC
----
1. DbRelease
major, minor, patch numbers; descriptive comment

2. SiteInfo
Site-specific information needed to run eTraveler, e.g. value to
use for $VIRTUAL_ENV environment variable required by Job Harness
