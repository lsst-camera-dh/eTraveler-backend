HARDWARE 
----------
1. HardwareType    [template]
Corresponds to drawing id (without revision #)

2. Hardware     [instance of HardwareType]
Instance of hardware type

3. HardwareStatus
List of allowed states for hardware, to include at least the following
values, likely others to come:

NEW (default value when new row is added to Hardware table)
IN_PROGRESS (at least one traveler has been begun)
REJECTED
READY    (preparation, testing, etc. complete. ready for integration)
USED

Hardware identifiers
--------------------
1. HardwareIdentifierAuthority  
e.g., BNL

2. HardwareIdentifier
Identifier unique to referenced authority for hardware of specific type

Hardware relationships
----------------------
1. HardwareReleationshipType    [template]
Associates two kinds of hardware, one subsidiary to the other, e.g.
raft and sensor where relationship is 'in slot 11'

2. HardwareRelastionship    [instance of HardwareRelationshipType]
Instance of 1. for specific components

PROCESS
-------
1. Process   [template]
Defines process step:
Primary hardware type, aux hardware type if any, children type

2. ProcessEdge   [template]
Defines relationships between process steps

3. Activity [instance of Process]
Where the rubber hits the road.  Execute a particular process with
particular component


EXCEPTIONS
----------
1. NCRcondition  
Recognized conditions which will initiate an NCR

2. Exception   [template]
Describes process step navigation in case a particular known condition occurs

PREREQUISITES
--------------
1. PrerequisiteType
Enumaration of kinds of prerequisites.  Includes as possibilities other
tracked hardware; other process steps, consumables, etc.

2. PrerequisitePattern [template]
Describes a prerequisite for a particular Process.  If it's a 
tracked hardware prereq, reference HardwareType id.  If it's a process step
prereq, reference Process id.

3. Prerequisite [instance of PrerequisitePattern]
